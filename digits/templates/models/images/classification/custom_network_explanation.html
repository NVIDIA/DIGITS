<h1>Specifying a custom Caffe network</h1>

<p>
    Use this field to enter a Caffe network in .prototxt format.
</p>

<p>
    Classification are special in a few ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Deploy network <b>must contain a Softmax layer</b>.
        This should produce the only network output.
    </li>
    <li>
        If any InnerProduct layers have left <i>num_output</i> unset, DIGITS will <b>fill it in for you automatically</b> with the number of classes in your dataset.
    </li>
    <li>
        If any Accuracy layer has a <i>top_k</i> value that is smaller than the number of classes in your dataset, then that layer is <b>removed</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The network should include the necessary layers for all computation states - Train, Val and Deploy.
    When searching for layers, the network will be set to one of these three states:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>phase: TRAIN stage: "train"</li>
    <li>phase: TEST stage: "val"</li>
    <li>phase: TEST stage: "deploy"</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your layer's include and exclude rules should be set properly to be picked up by the desired computation state[s].
    You can look at the standard networks for examples.
    In addition, since there are many ways to specify the rules, here's a table that you may find useful:
</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Rule</th>
        <th>Train</th>
        <th>Val</th>
        <th>Deploy</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>none</i></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>include { phase: TRAIN }</td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>include { stage: "train" }</td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>include { phase: TEST }</td>
        <td></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>include { stage: "val" }</td>
        <td></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td><td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>include { stage: "deploy" }</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>exclude { stage: "deploy" }</td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            include { stage: "train" }
            include { stage: "val" }
        </td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    You may notice that DIGITS still generates separate files for <i>train_val</i> and <i>deploy</i> networks, and that they each only use <i>phase</i> and not <i>stage</i>.
    This is because Caffe doesn't fully support all-in-one networks yet.
