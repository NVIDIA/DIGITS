## Installation

Follow [these instructions](UbuntuInstall.md) to install Deb packages for the latest major release on Ubuntu 14.04.

Follow [these instructions](BuildDigits.md) to build from source.

## Using the Webapp

Once you have installed and started DIGITS, open up a web browser and navigate to the home screen.
The server should be at either `http://localhost/` (if installed from Deb packages), `http://localhost:5000/` (if using `digits-devserver`) or `http://localhost:34448/` (if using `digits-server`).

![Home page](images/home-page-1.jpg)

For the example in this document, we will be using the [MNIST handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) as our dataset and [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) for our network.
Both are generously made available by Yann LeCun on [his website](http://yann.lecun.com/).

Use the following command to download the MNIST dataset (for Deb package installations, the script is at `/usr/share/digits/tools/download_data/main.py`):
```
$ python /usr/share/digits/tools/download_data/main.py mnist <address of the folder you want to put MNIST in>

See [Standard Datasets](StandardDatasets.md) for more details.

### Logging in

In the Datasets section on the left side of the page, click on the blue `Images` button and select `Classification`.
This will lead you to the login page:

![Login](images/login.jpg)

### Creating a Dataset

After logging in, you will be brought to the "New Image Classification Dataset" page.

* Type in the path to the MNIST training images
  * You can also add the the folder of MNIST test images as a "Separate validation images folder", if you like. Don't use the "test images" fields - test images are not used for anything in DIGITS yet.
* Change the `Image Type` to `Grayscale`
* Change the `Image size` to 28 x 28
* Give the dataset a name
* Click on the `Create` button

![New dataset](images/new-dataset.jpg)

While the job is running, you should see the expected completion time on the right side:

![Creating dataset](images/creating-dataset.jpg)

When the job is finished, go back to the home page by clicking `DIGITS` in the top left hand part of the page.
You should now see your dataset listed.

### Training a Model

In the Models section on the right side of the page, click on the blue `Images` button and select `Classification` which will take you to the "New Image Classification Model" page.  For this example, do the following:
* Choose the "MNIST" dataset in the `Select Dataset` field
* Choose the `LeNet` network in the `Standard Networks` tab
* Give the model a name
* Click on the `Create` button

![New model (top)](images/new-model-top-half.jpg)
![New model (bottom)](images/new-model-bottom-half.jpg)

While training the model, you should see the expected completion time on the right side:

![Training model](images/training-model.jpg)

To test the model, scroll to the bottom of the page.
* Click on the `Upload image` button and choose a file
  * There are plenty to choose from in `/home/username/mnist/test/`
* Or, find an image on the web and paste the URL into the `Image URL` field
* Check the `Show visualizations and statistics` box
* Click on `Classify One`

![Classifying one image](images/classifying-one-image.jpg)

At the top of the page, DIGITS displays the top five classifications and corresponding confidence values.
DIGITS also provides visualizations and statistics about the weights and activations of each layer in your network.
